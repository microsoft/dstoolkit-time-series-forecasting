# Configs

The **configs** directory contains sample configuration files to test end-to-end runs of a forecasting experiment on different size datasets, typical of regression testing scenarios.

- The `json` subdirectory contains ready-to-use sample configuration dictionaries.
- The notebooks `create_config_*` describes each field in the configuration file. Note that in order to work with the notebooks, you need to be in a databricks environment.
