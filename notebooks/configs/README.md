# Configs

The **configs** directory contains sample configuration files to test end-to-end runs of a forecasting experiment on variable datasets, typical of regression testing scenarios. The `json` subdirectory contains ready-to-use sample configuration dictonaries whereas the notebooks `create_config_*` describes each field in the configuration file.
